# Pave Ruby Coding Exercise

Hello from us at Pave! ðŸ‘‹

In this repo is an empty Ruby on Rails application ready for you to add pieces
to. Your challenge is to create a simple e-commerce app.

## The Challenge

Make a simple e-commerce app with as many of the following features as you have time to do (don't worry if you can't get them all done, we prefer quality over quanitity):

- [ ] There should be an index page which lists the products that are available
- [ ] Clicking on a product should show a details page
- [ ] You can add items to your cart from the details page
- [ ] There should be a cart page which shows the items in the cart and the total of everything in there
- [ ] Add a checkout option to the cart
- [ ] Allow a user to make a (fake!) payment and handle success and failure

Use the Git repo this comes in to make nice commits and push up your work to GitHub, sharing a link with us when you're done.

## What We're Looking For

Try not to spend too long on this challenge! We really value your time and would
rather see smaller examples that are better fleshed out than huge examples that
are not.

When we review your exercise, we'll ask you question about your approaches,
choices, design decisions, and quality of the code and tests. So make sure to
factor this in. But don't strive for perfection! Code in the real world is
full of trade-offs, so document your choices but don't be afraid to keep
things simple!
